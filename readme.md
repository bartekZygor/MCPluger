# 🎮 GTA V Mod Manager by apoki

> Created from scratch by one person – me. *ahh. unemployed dev.*

A simple and clean Mod Manager for **GTA V** that lets you **enable or disable your mods with a single click** – no need for double installations or manually moving files!

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ One-click **mod activation/deactivation**
- 🎵 Background music to make things less boring
- 🧠 Saves mod states automatically
- 🛠️ No need for reinstalling, file juggling, or second game folders

---

## 🧪 How It Works

You have **two folders**:

- `GTA V` – your main game folder  
- `mods_folder` – the folder where you keep all your mods

Two magic buttons:

- 🔌 `Plug` – copies files from `mods_folder` to your `GTA V` folder  
- 🔌 `Outplug` – moves mod files back to `mods_folder`, restoring the clean game

All mod states are saved automatically by updating files inside the `mods_folder`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

No rocket science. Just plug and play. Literally.
